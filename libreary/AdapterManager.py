class AdapterManager:
	"""
	The AdapterManager is responsible for all interaction with adapters, except for intial ingestion.

	It will be able to keep track of all of the adapters we have, do integrity checks on them,
	perform initial distribution, compare versions from different adapters, and make insert and delete calls.

	This is useful to keep the base Libreary class as simple as possible.
