class AdapterManager:
    """
    The AdapterManager is responsible for all interaction with adapters, except for intial ingestion.

    It is able to keep track of all of the adapters we have, do integrity checks on them,
    perform initial distribution, compare versions from different adapters, and make insert and delete calls.

    The Adapter Manager is responsible for most of the operation of ingestion, deletion, and management of
    digital objects within LIBREary. Most customization will occur by subclassing the AdapterManager.

    This class currently contains the following methods:

    - reload_levels_adapters (create adapter objects and set levels based on configuration)
    - get_all_levels (get levels based on what exists in metadata db)
    - get_all_adapters (create adapter objects based on levels)
    - set_additional_adapter (manually create an adapter object and add it to the AdapterManager's list of adapters)
    - verify_adapter (make sure an adapter is working properly)
    - create_adapter [static method] (factory function for adapter objects)
    - send_resource_to_adapters (send copies a resource to all the places they need to be)
    - get_adapters_by_level (get all adapters from a level)
    - delete_resource_from_adapters (delete non-canonical copies of an object)
    - change_resource_level (change the level of an object)
    - get_canonical_copy_metadata
    - summarize_copies
    - retrieve_by_preference (retrieve an object, prefering the canonical adapter)
    - check_single_resource_single_adapter (make sure that a copy matches the canonical copy)
    - verify_adapter_metadata (verify that a file can be retrieved)
    - get_resource_metadata
    - restore_canonical_copy (restore a faulty canonical copy)
    - compare_copies (check if two copies of a resource are the same)
    - verify_copy (check if a copy matches the canonicl copy)
