    This is the user-facing class for LIBRE-ary. Users of LIBRE-ary should only interact
    with this class directly. LIBRE-ary objects are able to handle all of the
    functionality of this module. Developers should feel free to extend the
    functionality of this class and are encouraged to submit pull requests
    to the main repository.

    This class currently contains the following methods:

    - ingest (load a resource into LIBRE-ary)
    - retrieve (retrieve a copy of an object)
    - delete (delete an object)
    - update (update an object)
    - search (search for information about objects)
    - run_full_check (check all resources to verify integrity)
    - check_single_resource (check only a single resource)

        Constructor for Libreary object.
            :param config_dir - a string pointing to a directory
            containing Libreary configuration. In the config directory
            must be a file called `config.json` which contains main
            configuration, and a separate config file for each adapter
            you plan to use. More detail on adapter configs can be found
            in the adapters constructor documentation.


            The structure of `config_dir/config.json` should be as follows:
            ```{json}
            {
                "metadata": {
                    "db_file": "path to SQLite3 DB file for metadata"
                },
                "adapters": # List of adapters - each entry should look like:
                [{
                    "type":"AdapterType (name of class)",
                    "id": "Adapter Identifier"
                }],

                    "dropbox_dir": "Path to dropbox directory, where files you want to ingest should be placed",
                    "output_dir": "Path to directory you want files to be retrieved to",

                "canonical_adapter":"Adapter Identifier for Canonical Adapter"
            }
            ```

            The canonical adapter is the adapter which will store the "canonical" copy
            of each resource, which will then be used as the "real" version of that digital object.

            This object creeates an adapter manager and an ingester. For more information,
            see those classes.

            The output and dropbox directories are volatile and should not be used for object storage.
