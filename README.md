# LIBREary [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/libre-ary/badge/?version=master)](https://libre-ary.readthedocs.io/en/master/?badge=master)


## What is this?

LIBREary is an adaptive and distributed digital archive system. It's meant to provide a resilient and distributed platform for carefully storing many copies of digital objects deemed to be of high importance.

It's designed to be as flexible as possible, with adapters for storage in many different environments across various types of technologies, including the cloud, local storage systems, other network systems, and more.

LIBREary is highly configurable and is able to store, update, retrieve, and ensure integrity of objects using many different storage backends, with configurable integrity checking and copy distribution.

## How does LIBREary work? What's the architecture like?

LIBREary is packaged as a python object, which contains several other objects. To configure LIBREary, first, a user must decide where they want data to be stored. To do this, they decide on a set of adapters to use. They must choose a single "canonical" adapter, which will store the most important copy of each resource in the LIBREary. Then, they choose a set of "levels," each of which consist of one or more adapters and a specified integrity check frequency.

They can begin to ingest digital objects into the LIBREary, which assigns them a unique identifier and stores copies of each to all of the adapters at each level they have been assigned to. Each resource will be checked for digital integrity ad a frequency also determined by the levels it has assigned to it. 

LIBREary is flexible - objects can have their levels changed as necessary, levels can be edited to have more or fewer adapters as needed, and objects can be stored or retireved as often as is needed. It's also fully distributed. Copies of objects can be stored anywhere that is supported via an adapter. The adapter interface is simple and open, so that users can create adapters easily based on their needs.

The LIBREary configuration process is relatively simple, and getting started with LIBREary should only take a few minutes.

An example of the configuration can be found in the `libre-ary/config` directory.

## How do I install LIBREary?

LIBREary is a python package, and can be istalled using python3's setup tools. First, make sure you have python3 installed on your system. Then:

`git clone https://github.com/benhg/libre-ary`

`cd libre-ary`

`python3 setup.py install`


After the `0.0.1` release (scheduled for 1/15/2019), LIBREary will be uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI) and will be `pip` installable.

## How do I interact with LIBRE-ary?
