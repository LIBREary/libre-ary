# LIBREary

## What is this?

LIBREary is an adaptive archive and backup system. It's designed to back up files, blocks, and other objects in various ways. It's able to store objects at different levels of "criticality"

It's designed to be as flexible as possible, with adapters for storage in many different environments across various types of technologies, including the cloud, local storage systems, other network systems, and more.

## List of Planned Adapters

In order to make backups in a specific environment, there will need to be an adapter. Eventually, the adapter interface will be open-sourced (and documented well). For now, the list of planned adapters includes the following:

	- AWS S3
	- AWS Glacier
	- Generic SQL Databases
	- Google Drive
	- Dropbox
	- Local Directory Storage
	- SMB Storage
	- Generic SQL Database
	- NoSQL Databases
	- Globus Endpoint transfers
